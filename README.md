## Wheel Me Up

We as Mile-adders believe in returning to the community, as it stands this is the age of technology and we want to carve our name in annals of history, so as a plan of creating multiple useful web applications, we started with creating a car renting web application where our users will enjoy and use our application to connect to each other in need of renting a car, so we designed an application that provides the ability to rent cars of any type and brand, directly from their owners, or a much better deal from car renting companies, and we believe that small things like that connects the world together.

The web application doesn't consist of a frontend yet. but in the final project it will have a frontend, written in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery and React. The backend was written in javascript using NodeJS, and Express.

An interface is provided to create new account in which you can
choose to rent a car, from another owner, or have a better from a renting company, or be the renter.
as a car owner you can post, view existing cars, edit existing cars data, delete existing cars, and search for cars.
all this functionality is done by using NodeJS, and Express.
