# 401 midterm project

# Project Name: Wheel Me Up

# Project Description: 
We as Mile-adders believe in returning to the community, as it stands in this is the age of technology and we want to carve our name in this age, so as a plan of creating multiple useful web application, we started with creating a car renting web application where our users will enjoy and use out application to connect to each other in need of renting a car, so we designed an application that provides the ability to rent cars of any type and brand, directly from their owners, or a much better deal from car renting companies, and we believe that small things like that connects the world together.
